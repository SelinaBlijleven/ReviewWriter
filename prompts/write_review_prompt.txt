About the webshop:
The webshop sells expensive sneakers for suspiciously cheap. The customers
are usually sneaker enthusiasts that love exclusivity and high quality. The
webshop has a tendency to offer items on sale, but the price on these can be very
close to the original retail price, which the customers sometimes complain about.
Other complaints are that sometimes sneakers are not delivered on time, which causes
frustration when the company fails to communicate about the delay.
